# Class 8 Truck Steering Market in North America

Overview

North America Class 8 Truck Steering Market Another major involvement that the heavy-duty vehicle industry has in North America is the class 8 truck steering market. By common reference, these are referred to as “big rigs” or “18-wheelers”; however, class 8 trucks are the mainstays in freight transportation and logistics across the North American continent. These are vehicles well suited for hauling heavy loads across very long distances and pretty fundamental in the chain of supply across the continent. The following blog outlines the Class 8 truck steering market, key drivers, challenges, and future outlook within North America. Overview of Class 8 Truck in North America

Importance

Weight and size make Class 8 trucks a little bit more complicated with respect to their steering system when compared with other small-sized vehicles. This should be strong enough to support such heavy loads and, at the same time, ensure precision in the control provided to the driver for maneuverability. Along with control over the vehicle, the steering system also contributes to reducing driver fatigue, a prime concern in the long-haul trucking sector. In modern times, with advanced technology, incorporation of the steering system with electronic control, power assistance, and automation have found great demand due to safety and performance. Demand for class 8 truck sophisticated steering solutions drives the steering market in North America.

Market Drivers

1. Growth in the Freight and Logistics Industry

All these factors have been encouraging growth in the Class 8 truck steering market in North America. Such drivers include growth in truck demand, advancements in technology in steering, and strict safety regulations. Among all these, a few of the major drivers in the Class 8 truck steering market are growth in the freight and logistics industry in North America. Long-haul trucks are supposed to play a major role in the United States, Canada, and Mexico because these countries have to transport goods for very long distances. With the recent rise of e-commerce coupled with globalization in trade, the need to keep ways of transportation reliable and efficient has never been so urgent. Thus, Class 8 trucks continue to be in high demand and a significant link in the supply chain, and strong steering mechanisms in these trucks are also gaining momentum in demand.

2. Improvement in Steering Technologies

Technological improvements in the steering mechanism, too, are another major driver in the market. The new Class 8 trucks in the market are deployed with updated power steering mechanisms, including but not limited to electric power steering and active steering mechanisms. Each of these technologies has offered improved control with better fuel efficiency, enhancing driver comfort. Also, demands rose for Class 8 trucks with advanced steering systems that would interface with other in-vehicle systems, such as automation, autonomous driving, braking, and lane-keeping assistance. 3. Stringent Safety and Emission Regulations

3. Stringent Safety and Emission Regulations

Government regulations on the safety of vehicles and emission also fuel the demand for Class 8 trucks with advanced steering systems. The governments of the U.S. and Canada, in North America, had passed strict regulations to bring down the carbon emissions and raise the safety of a vehicle. Such laid down regulations have compelled truck manufacturers to incorporate technologies into their products that improve fuel efficiency and prevent any accident. With every new technological advancement in steering, the integration of ESC and ACC also widened its adoption as it helped the truck manufacturer to meet these regulations.

Key Players

1. Robert Bosch GmbH

It is extremely well known as the world leader in automotive technology, especially in the commercial vehicle business, as Bosch’s steering solutions have secured their place in this field. From hydraulic to electric power steering, it has come up with several sets of systems for the heavy-duty trucks. Bosch Continues investing in autonomous driving technologies that one day will form part of Class 8 trucks.

2. ZF Friedrichshafen AG

ZF is another giant in the Class 8 truck steering market. The company offers a number of steering systems based on mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic technologies. For instance, one of the active steering systems developed by ZF adds more precision and stability, making these heavy-duty trucks highly suitable on the highway. Also, ZF is one of those major developers of autonomous vehicle technology and is expected to add even more to the already high demand for advanced steering solutions.

3. Nexteer Automotive

Nexteer Automotive designs and manufactures electric and hydraulic power steering systems for commercial vehicles, including Class 8 trucks. The Company’s state-of-the-art steering solutions address the minimization of the driver fatigue factor while ensuring advanced fuel economy and maintaining vehicle safety. It is also working toward integrating the steering systems with autonomous driving technologies.

Challenges

1. Advanced Steering System Cost is High

Adoption of electric power steering and autonomous steering systems is expensive. Advanced steering systems are costlier compared to the conventionally used hydraulic steering system, and this cost is usually transferred to big fleet operators and truck manufacturers. Although improved safety and fuel efficiency may be achieved by the employment of advanced steering systems, the high initial cost remains a serious impediment to their technology adoption for many small- to medium-sized fleet operators. 2. Low Rate of Adoption of New Technologies

2. Slow Adoption of New Technologies

Whereas such advances in steering systems are admittedly high, the implementation by truck manufacturers and fleet operators has been quite slow. The nature of the trucking industry- conventionally conservative, depends mostly on technologies based on reliability and durability. Unless the technology can be proved to be long-term reliable and economical, the decisions to invest in new technologies by truck operators are pretty skeptical

3. Supply Chain Disruptions

Similar to many other industries, supply chain disruptions are acting as a bottleneck for the Class 8 truck steering market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inability to procure crucial components, including semiconductors and other raw materials, is further delaying the production and delivery of the steering system. This further causes trickling down effects into the trucking industry, where production of the vehicle gets delayed, increasing its cost.

Future Outlook

1. Autonomous Trucks

Another trend in Class 8 manufacturing includes the integration of autonomous trucks. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are hugely investing in the development of autonomous driving technologies. Their integrations into Class 8 trucks are very well expected in a few years to come. Advanced types of steering technologies are in high demand as an autonomous truck would need an immensely advanced sort of steering system with completely no human interference.

2. Sustainability

The other powerful trend that can materialize in the Class 8 truck market is that of sustainability. The greater the politics and corporate interests in reducing carbon emissions levels, the greater will be the demand for electric and hybrid trucks. These will require, in turn, other kinds of steering systems-particularly those with electric power steering and friendlier electric drivetrains. With this segment of the electric Class 8 truck market continuing to evolve, demand for electric steering systems also evolves.

3. Increased Emphasis on Driver Comfort and Safety

Driving comfort and safety have become of utmost importance with the driver shortage hitting trucking industries across the world. Advanced steering systems guarantee reduced driver fatigue, easy maneuverability, and stability of the vehicle. This is indeed a trend here to stay, with fleet operators looking at attracting and retaining more drivers in today’s competitive labor market.
