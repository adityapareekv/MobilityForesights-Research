# Global Pyrheliometer Market: Growth, Trends, and Opportunities

Introduction

Pyrheliometer is a scientific instrument which is used to measure direct beam solar radiation. It is often used in meteorological and climatological observations, research in solar energy, generation of power, and other related fields. Pyrheliometers are crucial in monitoring the strength of solar energy-which is extremely vital in proper optimization of installations of solar panels, designing solar power plants and climate science. The relevance of pyrheliometers is invaluable in all the places where there is a need for high accuracy of solar irradiation. Such precise estimations by these devices will enhance the performance of systems based on solar energy. The results are that the systems based on solar energy are more efficient and feasible. With the new wave of international interest in renewable energy, the demand for such pyrheliometers would increase.

Market Outlook

The adoption of solar energy in every nook and corner of the world is influencing the growth of the pyrheliometer market. According to market research, the global pyrheliometer market size was approximately USD 27 million in the year 2020 and is anticipated to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-10% over the next ten years. This is due to the high uptake of pyrheliometers in the solar power industry and more awareness of the need for renewable sources of energy.

Market Drivers

1. Increasing Demand for Solar Energy

With a recent global thrust toward the renewable energy sector, demand for solar power has emerged. More and more government and private bodies and individuals seek a source of clean, renewable, and low-cost energy in the form of solar power. It's especially on the upswing in locations with plenty of sunshine, such as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.

2. Government Initiatives and Regulations

Many governments have devised policies and rules which aim at curtailing carbon emissions as well as fostering renewable sources of energy. The financial incentives, tax breaks, and subsidies in solar power projects such policies go on to spur demand for pyrheliometers.

3. Technological Growth

Other technological innovations in the design and manufacturing of solar energy systems are also benefiting the pyrheliometer market. Contemporary pyrheliometers are much more accurate, rugged, and easy to use compared to their predecessors and have thus become an indispensable tool for most professionals working in solar energy.

4. Environmental Consciousness Rise

Due to the alarmingly increasing anxieties about climate change and environmental degradation, many people and organizations are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. An ideal solution for that is by energy generated through sun, and an important factor that renders a solar power system to achieve its maximum efficiency is a pyrheliometer.

5. Investment in Solar Power Projects.

The other factor driving the growth of the global pyrheliometer market is the extensive investment in solar power projects. There are huge outlays by different governments, private companies, and investors into large-scale solar power plants and photovoltaic systems. Pyrheliometers become an important tool for optimizing those projects so that maximum power can be generated while taking in minimum costs.

Market Segmentation

By Type

Analog Pyrheliometers: Analog mechanical systems that measure solar irradiance. Even though they are in use, they are becoming an exception due to the increasing use of digital pyrheliometers.

Digital Pyrheliometers: This is more accurate than analog pyrheliometers since they are more advanced. They have real time data logging facilities, and hence, they are in wide usage in today's solar energy schemes.

By Application

Solar Power Plants: In most of the solar power plants, pyrheliometers are used for the measurement of direct beam radiation. Primarily, it is done for optimizing the performance of photovoltaic modules, hence enhancing the overall efficiency.

Meteorological Studies: Pyrheliometers, in the context of meteorology, are used to measure changes in weather and global warming for further study on solar irradiance in detail, which can thus form an important input into understanding atmospheric conditions.

Climatological Research. In climatology, pyrheliometers assist scientists in monitoring changes through solar radiation to find whether or not they affect global climate conditions.

By Region-Wise

North America: In North America, the need for pyrheliometers has been driven by growing use of solar energy and prominent solar power projects across the U.S. and Canada.

Europe: Pyrheliometer is one of the very prominent markets of Europe due to the strong initiative of the government regarding decrease in carbon emission and enhanced usage of renewable energy.

Asia-Pacific: This region will be growing at the most rapid pace in the market of pyrheliometer. Countries such as China and India are engaged actively in developing processes of solar systems.

Middle East and Africa: The region, too, witnesses a growing demand for pyrheliometers in the heavily sunlit countries of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, among others.

Challenges 

1. Inaugural Cost is Very High

Another serious drawback to the pyrheliometer market is its high cost of purchase. It is true that due to technological advancement, it has now become possible to manufacture more precise and reliable pyrheliometers. However, in general, compared to most instrumentation tools for measuring solar radiations, it is still costly. This may become a restriction to the use of pyrheliometers for any smaller solar projects or projects in the developing world.

2. Installation and Maintenance Complexity

The pyrheliometers are highly complex instruments and extremely difficult to install. Accompanying it with regular and accurate measurements requires time and money-consuming procedures, especially for big installations of solar power projects. Moreover, the installation and maintenance of pyrheliometers will need highly technical technicians, which can be problematic in certain parts of the world.

3. Non-Standardization

There is no harmonized measurement procedure in the pyrheliometer market among regions and industries due to which the measuring of the data related to solar irradiance gets inconsistent, thus results mismatched when comparative project or location outcomes are taken into account.

Outlook

The same trend is likely to survive for the next few years since more people get concerned with the use of solar energy and focus on renewable sources of energy leading to the installation of pyrheliometers. Improving technology, policies set by the government, and environmental concerns will increase demand for pyrheliometers. Increased investment by countries in solar power projects and their efforts to reduce carbon footprint shall act as a positive stimulus for the demand of pyrheliometers. Available, affordable, more readily procurable and user friendly pyrheliometers will fill up at least some of the gaps faced by the market as of now.
