# Global SCR Dosing Control Market: Growth, Trends, and Future Prospects

Introduction

SCR is the technology that tries to reduce harmful emissions from diesel engines-mainly nitrogen oxides, or NOx-said to be among the main causes of air pollution and creation of smog. The SCR system works by injecting into the stream of exhaust a urea-based solution commonly known as Diesel Exhaust Fluid, or DEF-and with the help of the catalyst, the NOx emissions are transformed into harmless nitrogen and water vapor. However, it becomes imperative in the SCR technology owing to the accurate dosing of DEF required in the exhaust stream. The efficient SCR dosing control system functions to reduce the NOx emission along with maintaining the consumption of DEF at minimum to further enhance the efficiency and cost of the emission control system.

Market Size and Growth

In the last years, the market for dosing control of SCR has seen steady growth with the implementation of tougher environmental regulations and wider usage of SCR technology in various industries, especially in automotive and power generation. A recent market research indicates that the SCR dosing control market will witness an approximate valuation of around USD 2.5 billion in 2023, reaching around USD 4.8 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of about 8.5% during the forecast period.

Key Market Drivers

1. Stringent Emission Regulations

One of the major drivers for the SCR dosing control market comes with the strict emission regulations set by various countries’ governments. Stricter emission standards have been issued in the regions of Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, therefore forcing mass adoption of the SCR technology in vehicles and related industrial segments. For instance, NOx emission norms of Euro VI in Europe and Tier 4 standards in the United States demand heavy-duty vehicles and industrial equipment to slash the level of NOx emissions drastically, thus creating an increasing demand for SCR systems and, therefore, for SCR dosing control systems.

2. Growing Automotive Industry

Amongst the automotive industry, the segment of commercial vehicles consumes more SCR dosing control systems. Better production of commercial vehicles, especially in developing nations like China and India, drives up demand for such technologies. Additionally, increasing consumers’ awareness about ecological issues and preference for eco-friendly vehicles accelerates the adoption of SCR systems in passenger cars, driving demand of the SCR dosing control market.

3. Technology improving

Growth in the market is related to the improvements in SCR technology, particularly in dosing control systems. The dosing control systems of modern SCR use advanced sensors and control algorithms to optimize the injection of DEF and contribute to efficiency at large. Advanced diagnostics, monitoring features, and performance are increasing demand due to the improved reliability of dosing control systems among end-users.

Segmentation

By Component-end

Pump Modules: These pump the DEF to the dosing unit.

Dosing Units: These are responsible for metering the quantity of DEF injected into the flow of exhaust gasses.

Sensors: These detect temperature, NOx levels, and DEF concentration, among others.

Controllers: These regulate the overall functioning of the dosing control system.

Of these, the dosing units have the largest share in the market due to the fact that they are highly crucial for an SCR system. However, the segment of sensors will also grow the most during the forecast period because new monitoring and diagnostic capabilities are increasing the demand for sensors in SCR systems.


By Application

Automotive- Commercial vehicles, Passenger cars, Off-highway vehicles.

Industrial: Power generation, marine machinery, and farm machinery.

The major chunk of the market share for the SCR dosing control comes from the automotive segment. This is probably the result of wide usage of SCR technology in commercial vehicles to get into strict emission standards. However, the industrial segment is supposed to see a significant pace due to the value of SCR systems in power plants and marine vessels to bring down the NOx emissions.

By Region

North America

Europe

Asia Pacific

Rest of the World (RoW)

Based on this, the largest share of the SCR dosing control market is dominated by Europe due to tight emission norms along with greater penetration of the SCR technology in commercial vehicles. During the forecast period, the fastest growth would be recorded by the Asia-Pacific region due to rapid industrialization, growing vehicle production, and augmenting environmental concerns in countries such as China and India.

Among these are product launches wherein the companies in leadership have been launching newer and more innovative SCR dosing control systems with increased operational specifications like real-time monitoring, more detailed diagnoses, and robustness.

Collaboration/Partnership: The leading players have entered into strategic collaborations/partnerships with automobile manufacturers and industrial equipment manufacturing companies with the aim of trying to reach better positions in overall market share while trying for better product development with more features.

Research and development: As many of the market players perform several R&D activities, there is likely the development of more efficient and cost-effective SCR dosing control systems, which could drive the market.

Emerging Trends

1. Electric and Hybrid Vehicles

P increased Market Penetration-Boon or Bane for Growth in the SCR Dosing Control Market. While electric vehicles do not require SCR systems, hybrid vehicles-let alone fitted with a diesel engine-may employ SCR technology to meet minimum emission standards. In the wake of automotive electrification, demand for SCR dosing control systems in conventional vehicles is likely to nosedive. On the other hand, the hybrid vehicle market could be the niche for SCR technology in the forthcoming years.

2. Integration of IoT with Big Data

Integration of emerging trends like IoT and Big Data analytics into the SCR dosing control systems may bring a revolution to the market. The new IoT-enabled SCR will be able to transmit in real time valuable data on DEF consumption, NOx levels, and system performance, thus enabling predictive maintenance to improve efficiency. Moreover, Big Data analytics enable the optimization of SCR dosing control systems as large volumes of data are analyzed for patterns that improve system efficiency.

Challenges

1. High Costs

Among the major factors impeding growth in the SCR dosing control market, high costs are starting to feature: of the SCR system and, consequently, the dosing control units. Indeed, the initial investment in the installation of SCR systems is particularly high in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. While at the same time, long-term advantages connected with reduced emissions and better fuel efficiency are in favor of the SCR technology as a reasonable solution for many industries.

2. Competition from Alternative Technologies

The SCR dosing control market presently faces stiff competition from alternative ways of emission reduction technologies such as EGR and LNT. Both these methods offer alternative ways of NOx emission reduction and could, therefore, find preference in certain applications thanks to their relative low cost and ease of integration. Nevertheless, SCR remains, up to now, the only solution to reach very high levels of NOx reduction, especially for heavy-duty vehicles as well as industrial applications.
