# Global ADAS Control Unit Market Trend, Forecast & Demand
The global ADAS control unit market is showing rapid growth due to the increase in demand for safety features of vehicles and the rise in adoption of autonomous driving technologies. ADAS control units have come to the fore as a very vital segment in today’s vehicles, wherein various sensors, cameras, and software come together to support a driver in decision-making vis-à-vis vehicle safety and reduce the potential risk of accidents. These systems include lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and collision avoidance — all of which are fast becoming regular features on a large number of new vehicles.

Government strict policies to have safety features in every vehicle, mainly in the developed regions like North America and Europe, act as a driver for the market growth. Again, increasing consumer awareness about vehicle safety and the continuous advancement in sensor technology and artificial intelligence are fuelling demand for ADAS control units. Besides, EV applications and the evolution of fully autonomous vehicles will offer considerable growth opportunities in the ADAS control unit market.

Though the market has become a bit challenging due to the high costs of ADAS systems and concerns over cyber security and data privacy, in spite of these odds, huge investments in research and development by key players in the automotive industry for innovating and bringing down costs make ADAS more accessible across various vehicle segments. The Asia-Pacific region, mainly China, is likely to prosper relatively during the coming years. This growth in demand may be caused by an increase in vehicle production and a higher rate of acceptance of new technologies in the automotive sector. The global ADAS control unit market is hence expected to grow at an exponential rate in the near future. Permanent technological development and regulatory support would be the two significant factors driving the growth of this market.

Trend

The global advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) control unit market is growing tremendously, basically on the ground of increased adoption around the globe of advanced safety features in vehicles. Often referred to as the ADAS systems’ ‘brain,’ it synthesizes data from a variety of sensors in cameras, radar, and LiDAR to enable a driver to make informed decisions in pursuit of advanced vehicle safety. Increasing concerns toward vehicle safety partnered by the government regulations to ensure the implementation of advanced driver-assistance systems functionalities in the new vehicles are favoring the market growth. Moreover, increasing consumer demand for autonomous and semi-autonomous driving technologies is giving tailwinds to the market.

Advances in sensor fusion and artificial intelligence technologies allow for the development of much more sophisticated control units that process a vast amount of data in real time, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of features like lane-departure warnings, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking of ADAS. In addition, increasing market penetration of electric and connected vehicles has increased the growth rate of the market since it is expected that these vehicles would use more advanced systems of ADAS. However, high costs involved in these systems and integration complexities of numerous sensing and technological systems in a single control unit are the factors that prohibit market growth to a certain extent. Despite these difficulties, the market for the ADAS control unit will continue being up, driven by the continuous development of automotive technology and the increasing concern about vehicle safety.

Forecast

The global ADAS control unit market is forecasted to grow enormously during the next few years. This may be due to increasing demands on vehicle safety features, rapidly growing technology, and the initiative going on all over the world for autonomous driving. The ADAS control units are major components in processing data taken from sensors, cameras, and radars to help a driver make decisions, ensuring not just the safety but also the efficiency of driving operations. The more innovating and integrating of the more sophisticated ADAS features into the vehicles continues to take place by the automotive manufacturers, the more advanced and reliable control units will be required.

One of the major drivers pushing the ADAS Control Unit market is regulatory pressure to enhance vehicle safety. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are legislating certain ADAS features, such as lane departure warning systems, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control, to be available in both passenger and commercial vehicles. This demand for these ADAS features has been accelerated due to the fact that these systems require accurate, fast processing of data for proper functioning; this increases the demand for ADAS control units. Increasingly, the trend of autonomous vehicles is also being felt. As OEMs make giant leaps towards developing self-driving cars, the complexity and capability of ADAS control units are bound to change. These units will have to process a higher amount of data with greater accuracy and speed, thus pushing the development of more advanced control units. One of the major trends that is foreseen during the coming years is to get an integration of AI and machine learning algorithms to have decision-making capabilities within such systems.

North America and Europe will continue to dominate the regional market due to strict safety regulations and higher awareness on the part of consumers about vehicle safety. However, the fastest growing region would be the Asia-Pacific region owing to the rapid expansion of the automotive industry along with growing disposable incomes and increasing adoption of advanced technologies in emerging economies like China and India. In a nutshell, the Global ADAS Control Unit market is set for remarkable growth given the regulatory imperatives, improvements in vehicle technology, and a sea change toward autonomous driving. With further evolution of the automotive sector, this demand for more advanced and more efficient ADAS control units will increase manifold, providing much-needed attention and a concentration area for both automotive manufacturers and technology providers.

Demand

The rise in demand for vehicle safety features and a trend toward technologies for autonomous driving have set the pace for the global ADAS control unit market. An advanced driver assistance system control unit makes a number of safety features operational, including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and others. As most of the world’s governments are now imposing strict regulations with respect to vehicle safety, the initiative of implementing ADAS technologies in the vehicles by automotive manufacturers is also boosted, further increasing the demand for ADAS control units.

Factors like the growth in electric vehicles and the consumer trend toward connected vehicles have been fueling the ADAS control unit market. Since electric vehicles have more sophisticated electronic architectures, support for sophisticated ADAS systems that ensure safety and efficiency cannot be ruled out. Besides, manifold development in sensor technology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning applied to ADAS control units in a more reliable and efficient way is proposed. This kind of technological development is expected to steer the market growth further.

Moreover, increased investments made by the automotive OEMs and tech companies in autonomous vehicles as a new opportunity area for the ADAS control unit market. The push to higher SAE levels of vehicle autonomy — Level 3 and above — necessitates that ADAS control units process complex decision-making in real time. The demand for advanced ADAS control units has been showing great dynamism in responding to the current developments in the totally autonomous vehicle manufacture of the automotive sector forecasted in the coming years, and this is tending to drive up the market during the forecast period.
