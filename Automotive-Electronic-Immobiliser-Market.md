# The Global Automotive Electronic Immobiliser Market: A Comprehensive Analysis

The automotive electronic immobilizer is developed to act as the anti-theft device that tries to keep each automobile theft away. It works in such a manner that, without the right key or the presence of an electronic token, it keeps the engine at a disarmed stage. The simplest form of immobilizer system would contain an immobilizer or a transponder chip that is fitted into the key, an antenna implanted around the ignition barrel, and one engine control unit. Turning the key in the ignition or pushing the start button gives a signal from the ECU to the chip inside the transponder. The answer to this, in the case of the chip sending the correct code, will be to allow the ECU to enable the engine to start. Otherwise, in the case of it not happening, the engine stays in its place.

Growth Drivers 

1. Rising Incidents of Vehicle Stealing

This factor has been marked to create demand for this market, as many vehicle thefts have been noted to grow around the globe. Reports suggest that millions of vehicles are considered to be stolen in a year, causing immense financial loss for the owners and the insurance companies. Growing cases of vehicle theft have forced automakers to incorporate electronic immobilizers as compulsory fitment for all their offerings. In fact, immobilizers' efficiency in theft prevention has made more acceptance by the customers hence more market demand.

2. Strict Government Regulations

The installation of anti-theft systems in vehicles has various regulatory policies set by different governments. For example, the European Union made it compulsory for every new car manufactured from the year 1998 to install an immobilizer system. Similarly, North America and Asia-Pacific countries also initiated some regulatory policies that ensure higher security in vehicles. This kind of regulatory policy contributes a lot to raise demand for electronic immobilizers; this, in turn, drives the market.

3. Technological Advances

This in turn was greatly facilitated by the technological advances made in car security systems. Higher forms of keyless entry systems, biometric authentications and higher levels of encryption have made the security provided by immobilizers much superior. Hence, now immobilizers are being integrated with other in car systems like GPS tracking and remote diagnostics in order to increase their efficiency and reliability. These technological innovations further enhance the efficiency of immobilizers and speed up the rate at which they find application in the automotive industry.

4. Growth in Demand for Connected Cars

The growth in demand for connected cars is another influential factor in the automotive electronic immobilizer market. These relate to a greater number of features concerning convenience and safety. A connected car is a car installed with an advanced communication system that supports interaction with external devices and infrastructure. Immobilizers installed in connected cars can be remotely operated and controlled for enhanced security. Thus, growing demand and increasing adoption of the connected cars, primarily in the developed economies, have boosted demand for advanced immobilizer systems.

Challenges

1. High Costs

The installation costs are very high and involve a lot of money. Advanced installations like keyless entry and biometric authentications raise the prices at which the motor vehicles are sold. The price-sensitive consumers avoid buying the same expensive cars. The car manufacturers should have a delicate balance that gives all these advanced technologies at very competitive prices.

2. Hacking Vulnerability

Now, with increased intelligent and connected vehicles on the road, they turn out to be more hack-prone. Critical vulnerabilities in vehicle software or in the communication system may be used by any hacker in an attempt to bypass electronic immobilizers. Though manufacturers are trying their best to continuously upgrade the safety features of their immobilizers, there is a very current risk of hacking. Such a possibility, in turn, may dent consumer confidence in electronic immobilizers and act as a deterrent factor in the growth of the market.

3. Compatibility Issue

Incompatibility between the electronic immobilizer and the model of the car are other deterring factors of the market. Immobilizers are fitted as a norm in new cars. However, the immobilizer system of the old models of cars is cumbersome and costly hence making the immobilizers market to be relatively smaller in the after-market segment. This might pose a challenge in the integration of immobilizers into other in-vehicle systems, such as infotainment and telematics, mainly for those vehicles whose technologies are behind the times.

Regional Analysis

Increased vehicle thefts coupled with stringent regulations by the governing bodies made North America one of the prominent regions for automotive electronic immobilizers. The US accounts for the largest share of this market, due to a well-established automotive industry in the region, along with increased automotive security. This is due to leading automobile manufacturers and technology providers residing in the region. Rising usage of connected cars in North America also contributed to the demand for advanced immobilizer systems. Another major market for automotive electronic immobilizers is Europe, as it contains major countries such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, which account for some of the biggest markets. The strict automobile safety regulations in the region meant that each new vehicle was installed with an immobilizer. Moreover, the gradually progressive technological ecosystem of the automotive industry in Europe paved the way for high-quality systems for immobilizers. Due to these factors, strong demand for its luxury and high-performance vehicles-most of which already offered top-tier security features-pushed Europe's market too.

The market of the Asia-pacific region is likely to report substantial growth in the forecast period. High growth in the automotive industries in developing nations such as China, India, and Japan has resulted in a high demand for vehicle security systems. An alarming rate of theft incidents in the region has further forced consumers to get their vehicles fitted with advanced features in order to ensure security. Also, the middle-class population in the developing Asia-Pacific regions will be developed and increase disposable incomes which will result in demand for immobilizers-equipped vehicles. The emerging markets for automotive electronic immobilizers are Latin America and the Middle East & Africa. Owning a vehicle is increasingly becoming a trend, which in turn has increased incidences of thefts of vehicles in these nations and hence have further increased the demand for immobilizers. However, high costs of such systems may restrain market growth in price-sensitive markets. Nevertheless, with further development of the automotive industry in these regions, the adoption of electronic immobilizers will continue to see significant growth.

Future Outlook

1. Integration with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems

One of the future trends in the integration of electronic immobilizers comprises the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. The development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems was to support the driver by avoiding accidents, incorporating features such as lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking. Hence, the integration of immobilizers with ADAS for safety and security would place the car manufacturer in a position to offer an integrated approach toward vehicle security. This trend of integration will ensure demand for advanced immobilizer systems in the future.

2. Increasing Penetration of Electric Vehicles

Adoption of electric vehicles opens a new frontier for the automotive electronic immobilizer market, both in terms of challenges and opportunities. On one hand, electric vehicles offer a new platform for immobilizers, though the architecture for those vehicles may be different and may demand some specialized immobilizer systems. The second aspect involves growing interest in green technologies and sustainable development that can further provoke demand for immobilizer systems to be eco-friendly and consume less energy.

3. Increasing Trend in the Aftermarket Segment

This aftermarket segment will mark the largest growing market segment as, with a rise in the number of consumers who intend to retro-fit their existing vehicles with modern security features. OEMs will develop immobilizers that act as cost-effective solutions for the aftermarket, thereby proving to be an attractive opportunity for the market to develop. Furthermore, vehicle up-gradation and customization trends are likely to favor the demand for immobilizers in the aftermarket.
